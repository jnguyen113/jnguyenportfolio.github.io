									<h2><a href="#">My Journey to Learning Code <br /> 
										</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Johnathan Nguyen and I wanted to share my journey with programming. I didn’t always enjoy coding, 
                                        I started walking into my freshman year of college just as a Computer Science major because I always wanted to 
                                        do something technical. I went into my first programming class and was completely lost. I remember the tests were 
                                        so difficult and did not think I would make it through the class. I’ve had little to no experience with coding. My 
                                        friends were always telling me to switch to another major like Computer Information Systems, which is similar to 
                                        Computer Science, but more business-related. However, that didn’t stick with me. I questioned myself and said do I 
                                        want to take the easy way out? Although business isn’t easy either, I did like the idea of a business major, but 
                                        something in my heart was telling me no. I stuck with my guts and continued to keep my major as Computer Science. 
                                        Entering into my sophomore year, one of my good friends I met in one of my CS classes switched his major to CIS, 
                                        so I began asking him was it the right move for him? He kept telling me yes and how it’s less coding and how it 
                                        was easier. My sophomore year was pretty tough, this was when I started taking more CS classes and it only got 
                                        harder. Now was when I really doubted myself and said, is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life? 
                                        If I switch majors now, I’ll be so behind. I continued to stick with my guts and pursued my education in Computer 
                                        Science. Now junior year came by and my life changed. I was a part-time advisor for Apple and still a full-time 
                                        student at GSU. Facebook had a program with GSU where they were sending their engineers in residence to come to 
                                        teach us. This professor that taught me Data Structures and Algorithms completely changed my view of coding. He 
                                        told me all coding is really about is problem-solving. If you like problem-solving, you’ll love coding. I thought 
                                        about it and it’s true. You are given a problem to solve, and you solve it by telling the computer what you want 
                                        it to do. Sounds simple right? This professor got my confidence that I chose the right major and wanted to keep 
                                        doing this. This was the year that I’ve learned the most out of my entire time at GSU. Right before that semester 
                                        ended, I landed my first internship as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst Intern at OneTrust for the Summer of 
                                        2020. Well, the entire world entered into one of the biggest pandemics we have faced. Covid-19 was spreading so 
                                        rapidly. Well, my internship from what I knew was still on according to the email that they sent. I trusted it was 
                                        still on, although I knew something was up because I didn’t hear anything back until 5 days before the internship 
                                        start date, I got a call from the recruiter and she told me my internship was rescinded. My heart sunk, I didn’t 
                                        even know what to do. At this time, I was still working for Apple, but I told them I was leaving because I had an 
                                        internship lined up. Well the Summer of 2020 could’ve been a disaster. OneTrust gave me such a late notice that it 
                                        gave me little time to react, but I wasn’t mad at the company or anything. I understood that it wasn’t just me that 
                                        this pandemic has affected. I still could have stayed with Apple and would have been moving up with them, but I 
                                        wanted to take this time to truly learn code. I decided to quit my job at Apple and follow what I was passionate 
                                        about. I viewed this an a door that opened me up to more opportunities. With so much time home, I did Hackerrank 
                                        problems every day, learned to build this portfolio, and worked on many group projects with my friends. I knew 
                                        everything happened for a reason, and my instructor told me that this summer is all going to be up to my mentality 
                                        and how productive I’ll be. I didn’t want to waste 3 months of summer playing games all day or anything similar 
                                        to it. So, I spent this summer working on this portfolio and the projects attached. I hope you enjoy it and thanks 
                                        for reading!</p>
