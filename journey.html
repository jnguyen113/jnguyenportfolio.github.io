									<h2><a href="#">My Journey to Learning Code <br /> 
										</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Johnathan Nguyen and I wanted to share my journey with programming. I didn’t always enjoy coding, 
                                        I started walking into my freshman year of college just as a Computer Science major because I always wanted to 
                                        do something technical. I went into my first programming class and was completely lost. I remember the tests were 
										so difficult and did not think I would make it through the class. I’ve had little to no experience with coding prior college. 
										My friends were always telling me to switch to another major like Computer Information Systems, which is similar to 
										Computer Science, but more business-related. However, that didn’t stick with me. My heart was telling me no, so 
										I stuck with my guts and continued to keep my major as Computer Science. Entering into my sophomore year, one of 
										my good friends I met in one of my CS classes switched his major to CIS, so I began asking him was it the right 
										move for him? He kept telling me yes and how it’s less coding and how he liked it more. My sophomore year was 
										pretty tough, this was when I started taking more CS classes and it only got harder. Now was when I really
                                        doubted myself and said, is this really what I want to do for the rest of my life? If I switch majors
                                        now, I’ll be so behind. I continued to stick with my guts and pursued my education in Computer Science. 
                                        Now junior year came by and my life changed. I was a part-time advisor for Apple and still a full-time 
                                        student at GSU. Facebook had a program with GSU where they were sending their engineers in residence to come to 
                                        teach us. This professor that taught me Data Structures and Algorithms completely changed my view of coding. He 
                                        told me all coding is really about is problem-solving. If you like problem-solving, you’ll love coding. I thought 
                                        about it and it’s true. You are given a problem to solve, and you solve it by telling the computer what you want 
                                        it to do. Sounds simple right? This professor gave me confidence that I chose the right major and wanted to keep 
                                        doing this. This was the year that I’ve learned the most out of my entire time at GSU. Right before that semester 
                                        ended, I landed my first internship as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst Intern at OneTrust for the Summer of 
                                        2020. Well, the entire world entered into one of the biggest pandemics we have faced. Covid-19 was spreading so 
										rapidly. My internship was rescinded 5 days before the start date. At this time, I was still working for Apple, 
										but I told them I was leaving because I had an internship lined up. Well the Summer of 2020 could’ve been a disaster. 
										I had very little time to react, but I wasn’t mad at the company or anything. I understood that it wasn’t just me that 
                                        this pandemic has affected. I still could have stayed with Apple and would have been moving up with them, but I 
                                        wanted to take this time to truly learn code. I decided to quit my job at Apple and follow what I was passionate 
                                        about. I viewed this an a door that opened me up to more opportunities. With so much time home, I did Hackerrank 
										problems every day, learned to build this portfolio, and worked on many group projects with my friends. I've only 
										also dealt with Java at GSU, and wanted to explore other languages. I started learning HTMl, Javascript, and CSS 
										and absolutely loved it. The idea of being in control and solving problems became something I enjoyed more everyday. 
										I knew everything happened for a reason, and my instructor told me that this summer is all going to be up to my mentality 
                                        and how productive I’ll be. I didn’t want to waste 3 months of summer playing games all day or anything similar 
										to it. Shortly after, I joined a company called HackYourOwn. At first, I started of as a Software Engineer Intern. During this time, 
										I programmed a bot that would manage teams and members. Our channel grew to 1,000 members quick! Then, the founder really needed help, 
										so I wanted to serve the community in any way that I could. Eventually, I moved up roles and became a Global Community Lead, where I created a 
										project track for members that joined and managed teams on their performance. The Summer of 2020 was definitely a summer
										I'll never forget. You don't have the ability to control what goes on in the world, but you can control your mentality towards it.</p>
