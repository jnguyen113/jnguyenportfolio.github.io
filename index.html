									<h2><a href="#">My Name is <br /> 
										Johnathan Nguyen</a></h2>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio, I am a senior studying Computer Science
										at Georgia State University. In this portfolio, <br>
										I wanted to share how I learned to code and the projects 
										that I have been working on over the Summer of 2020. This site was created using
										a template from html5up called "Massively". I have attached my 
										LinkedIn and Github in the top right hand corner. Below this are some of the projects that 
										I have worked on by myself or school projects. Feel free to explore!</p>

									<p>To start off with a simple project, I decided to make a short rock, paper, scissors game a user can play with the computer. It was something I wanted to do in order to try out other such as HTML and CSS. Play below, first to 3 wins!</p>

									<p>In this project, I learned about the use of AGILE methodology. We had 3 separate sprints. FOr the first sprint, I was the programmer doing research and development for the frameworks we were going to use. For the second sprint, I was the 
										Scrum Master distributing roles and timelines for when issues should be populated. We used an application called Zenhub to track our team's progress. On our final sprint, I was the Project Manager working on presenting our final product. 
										Our product is a real-time database that monitors Mercury Messenger's application. This was a two-team project, so we had to collaborate with the other team's app and get it to connect. This was the most challenging, yet most rewarding 
										project yet.

									<p>This contains all the work that I am currently working on in Web Programming. The summer has prepared me for this class, and I am still learning and implementing
										the knowledge gained in this class to my own personal projects. This portfolio only used HTML and CSS as it is one of our first assignments and we could not use 
										other resources if it has not been taught yet. Feel free to check out the progression throughout my Web Programming Course!
